# Some-Small-Projects--Monty-Hall-

This Repository contains some small projects to expand my coding skills and algorithmic thinking.

fibonacci.py contains a program to print out a selected amount of fibonacci numbers to a list.
  It also contains a function to apply the fibonacci function to any pair of positive integers the user chooses.
  
ackermann.py is an exploration of the ackermann function.

three_doors.py is an ongoing project to represent the Monty Hall problem of game theory.

rpg.py should be self-explanatory.  It is a work in progress, still in the early stages.
